\section{Data}
For many traditional bracket competitions predictions only need to be a binary result (i.e. win or lose); however, there are competitions for which probabilistic predictions  are required.  Furthermore, this provides a sensible framework for evaluating various loss functions and computing risk for various prediction schemes.  Hence, we restrict our focus to methods that return a probability of a team winning any matchup.
\subsection{Common Ratings Components} wins, losses, strength of schedule...

\subsection{Other influential factors} home court, height, ect...
\subsection{team level data vs. player level data}
