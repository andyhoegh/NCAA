\section*{Editor Comments}
{\bf Overview:} \emph{This revision is a much improved version of the original manuscript. In addition to the reviewers' comments, please address the following issues in a revision.}
\subsection*{Major Comments:}
{\bf Comment 1: } \emph{On page 16, the modeling framework for point spreads is presented as an additive model in the predictors, but the application exclusively focuses on a linear model even though you acknowledge exploring various smoothers. Please carry out one of the following changes: \\
(a) Substitute a linear model for the one in equation (2), as this is your main modeling approach. You can then mention that extensions to the linear model are possible, such as the use of additive models, but that these extensions are not explored in your manuscript. Make sure that previous to Section 3.1 you do not mention additive models as your main approach.\\
(b) Keep the start of Section 3.1 as is, but demonstrate the results of an non-parametric additive (non-linear) model. This would have major implications for the results in Section 4.\\
My recommendation would be (a). This does not diminish the novelty of your approach, in my opinion.}\\
\\
{\bf Response:} blah blah \\
\\
{\bf Comment 2:} \emph{I found some instances of unnecessary text. Section 2.1 should be substantially reduced, and perhaps combined with the rest of Section 2 without being its own subsection. Specifically, the first paragraph of Section 2.1 takes too much text to explain the relatively intuitive notion that there is more information in point scores than in binary indicators of wins. The second paragraph similarly goes on too long, and the accompanying figure is unnecessary. Again it is a relatively straightforward idea that if you are modeling the distribution of point spreads, then the probability a team wins is the probability the point spread is greater than 0. Finally the first paragraph of Section 3 can be removed entirely.}
\\
{\bf Response:} blah blah \\
\\
{\bf Comment 3:} \emph{Some of the notation you define is a bit awkward, but I believe can be remedied easily. At the top of page 17 where you define the $K$ nearest neighbors of team $j$, I strongly recommend defining $\mathcal{N}_j$ to be the set of team indices that are among the $K$ nearest neighbors to team j. Then at the bottom of page 17, define the average residual to be 
\begin{eqnarray*}
R_j(i)=\frac{1}{K} \sum_{k \in \mathcal{N}_j}*y_{(i,k)} - \mu_{(i,k)}).
\end{eqnarray*}
The current expression you have at the bottom of page 17 is not correct notation. You would then need to make the small change in Equation (4) replacing $\mathcal{N}$ with $R$.\\ 
Some minor notational issues are listed below.}\\
\\
{\bf Response:} blah blah \\
\\
{\bf Comment 4:} \emph{It would be helpful to see in Section 4.1 a table that presented the 2014 NCAA tournament games with the largest values of $\phi_{(i,j)}$ (positive or negative), along with a brief accompanying discussion. This would highlight the impact of the main contribution to your modeling framework.}

{\bf Response:} blah blah \\
\subsection*{Minor Comments}
{\bf Comment 1:} \emph{Page 12, line 47: Add quotes to ``at large''.}\\
\\
{\bf Response:} blah\\
\\
{\bf Comment 2:} \emph{Page 13, line 16: the exact methodology is unpublished. (it is know to Sagarin)}\\
\\
{\bf Response:} blah\\
\\
{\bf Comment 3:} \emph{Page 14, line 29: The point differentials are not ``continuous.'' Use a different term (e.g., quantitative).}\\
\\
{\bf Response:} blah\\
\\
{\bf Comment 4:} \emph{Page 14, line 46. Assuming you keep this (probably should not), you need to define $p(y_{(i,j))}$.}\\
\\
{\bf Response:} blah\\
\\
{\bf Comment 5:} \emph{Page 16, Equation (2): Here you define $Y_{(i,j)}$ to be the point spread and later you use lowercase $y_{(i,j)}$. This needs to be consistent.}\\
\\
{\bf Response:} blah\\
\\
{\bf Comment 6:} \emph{Page 16, line 10: The sentence beginning with ``Where for'' is not a sentence.}\\
\\
{\bf Response:} blah\\
\\
{\bf Comment 7:} \emph{Page 16, Section 3.2: Do not use the term ``foe'' in place of ``opponent.''}\\
\\
{\bf Response:} blah\\
\\
{\bf Comment 8:} \emph{Page 18, Equation (5): Why is there a k in $\epsilon_{(i,j)k}$?}\\
\\
{\bf Response:} blah\\
\\
{\bf Comment 9:} \emph{Page 19, line 15: Data were (not ``is'')}\\
\\
{\bf Response:} blah\\
\\
{\bf Comment 10:} \emph{Page 19, Section 4.1: The references to Kaggle are not necessary. You can remove the second column of Table 2 and remove the references to Kaggle in the first paragraph and the material is just as clear}\\
\\
{\bf Response:} blah\\

\section*{Reviewer 1 Comments}
{\bf Overview:} \emph{The author(s) present very well written innovative paper investing the incorporation of numerous facets of the game which impact the team's style of play and that of their opponnent's. It seems reasonable that different types of play like ``run and shoot'' and more deliberate play would effect the point spread and the outcome. The author(s) illustrate that this is the case in many situations.}\\
\\
\subsection*{Minor Comments}
{\bf Comment 1:} \emph{Page 3. Section 1.2, Should be March instead of May.}\\
{\bf Response:} blah blah.\\
\\
{\bf Comment 2:} \emph{Page 3. 6 lines from bottom -- therefore.}\\
{\bf Response:} blah blah.\\
\\
{\bf Comment 3:} \emph{Page 8. one line below equation (3), Why subscript ``1''}\\
{\bf Response:} blah blah.\\
\\
{\bf Comment 4:} \emph{Page 8. last line section 2. While the games are supposed to be played on neutral sites, what often happens is that the games are played on close proximity to one of the teams.}\\
{\bf Response:} blah blah.\\
\\
{\bf Comment 5:} \emph{Page 11. 11 lines from the bottom mentions ``dashed line.'' My figure 2 does not have a dashed line.}\\
{\bf Response:} blah blah.\\
\\
{\bf Comment 6:} \emph{Page 12. Table 3 Memphis - Virginia should read 0.28/0.21}\\
{\bf Response:} blah blah.\\
\\
{\bf Comment 7:} \emph{Appendix. How are turnovers counted. Are they included in steals? }\\
{\bf Response:} blah blah.\\
\\
{\bf Comment 8:} \emph{Appendix. Should there be (.5 \% field goal for 3 point + \% field goals made?}\\
{\bf Response:} blah blah.\\

\section*{Reviewer 2 Comments}
{\bf Overview:} \emph{The paper tries to account for style matchups between teams when predicting NCAA basketball tournament outcomes (most previous methods just rank and/or rate teams, without looking at specific matchups). The approach is similarity-based: if Team A is playing Team B, how well has Team A performed against teams similar to B, and vice versa? That information is used to modify the expected point margin between the two teams. The paper shows a small improvement in predictive ability, with some specific games showing larger differences.}
\subsection*{Major Comments}
{\bf Comment 1:} \emph{Overall, I think this is a much-improved version of the original paper, both in content and in writing.}\\
\\
{\bf Response:} blah blah\\
\\
{\bf Comment 2:} \emph{The only important missing piece I see here is that the significance of the improvement is not discussed. Is improvement (in Kaggle score, for example, or in any other metrics such as performance in games where the matchup component suggests adjusting the line by X or more points) statistically significant (or how do confidence intervals overlap, etc.)? The discussion of the role of chance was removed with the Kaggle piece, but a bit of it seems to be relevant to this question. [The same question applies to Response 2 to Reviewer 1, where an improvement over Sagarin is mentioned.]} \\
\\
{\bf Response:} blah blah\\
\\
{\bf Comment 3:} \emph{The abstract is out-of-date; the Kaggle piece hasn't been removed and it still promises a ``tempering'' of expectations due to the role of chance.}\\
\\
{\bf Response:} blah blah
\subsection*{Minor Comments}
{\bf Comment 1:} \emph{Since you mention transitivity in the motivation, how non-transitive do your predictions really get? (Is almost all of the difference just slightly different estimated margins of victory?)}\\
\\
{\bf Response:} blah blah\\
\\
{\bf Comment 2:} \emph{ESPN's BPI is also a (very) good and widely-recognized ranking system.}\\
\\
{\bf Response:} blah blah\\
\\
{\bf Comment 3:} \emph{You might want to mention other similarity-based predictive models in sports -- for example, PECOTA (for predicting a baseball player's yearly totals) uses a similar nearest neighbor analysis [and it's especially interesting because its author (Silver) then used similar methodology in his well-known election forecasts].}\\
\\
{\bf Response:} blah blah\\
\\
{\bf Comment 4:} \emph{It might be interesting if you could show some clusters of similar teams, as well as what defines them.}\\
\\
{\bf Response:} blah blah\\
\\
{\bf Comment 5:} \emph{Since you mention Sagarin, it might be interesting to include M Sagarin in Table 2.}\\
\\
{\bf Response:} blah blah\\
\\
{\bf Comment 6:} \emph{It wasn't perfectly clear to me whether your results are based on just last year, or over a longer time span.}\\
\\
{\bf Response:} blah blah
