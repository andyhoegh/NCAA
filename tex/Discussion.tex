\section{Discussion}
As shown in the the section on luck, chance coupled with a relatively small sample size makes this NCAA prediction a difficult task.  Nevertheless, we provide some sound methods and techniques for filling out a bracket or making game-by-game predictions.  Our matchup effects model is an intuitive means for adjusting probabilities based on matchup specific characteristics.  While there undoubtably is a more principled way to carry out this exercise, and given the time constraints, we found this to be effective.

Other considerations would be to use injury data for players as Nate Silver's 538.com does.  However, this particular competition required predictions for the complete tournament in advance of the first games.  Nevertheless, knowing the status of Kansas's Joel Embiid would have shifted probabilities for Kansas and similarly the effect of Iowa State's Georges Niang injury prior to the sweet sixteen matchup with Connecticut would undoubtedly have been different.

Something else that may be beneficial would be to use the score with two minutes to go, for example, to quantify how a game was.  As any fan can attest, the strategy of fouling can lead to dramatically different scores as can garbage time minutes by reserves, which results in a distorted view of how close the game was.  However, the time constraints for this year's competition deterred us from pursuing this - perhaps next year.
