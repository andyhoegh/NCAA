Having detailed popular methods for prediction and outlined our new methodology that accounts for specific match ups, the final component of this paper addresses the high degree of chance present in NCAA tournaments and consequently prediction for NCAA tournaments.  Specifically we address how sensitivity in a Kaggle style leader board . It's natural to think 2nd place almost won, but how close was 20th place to winning? 

% some verbiage in here... 

To study the effect of luck we take the idea that the 2nd place team almost won and we attempt to quantify `almost'. There are several ways one might consider to conduct a study of this sort, we examine alternate realities where a losing team in a game is treated equally as a winning team in the case of an overtime. We focus only on overtime games because it seems reasonable to consider the fact that these games could have gone either to the victor or the loser. Recalling that the loss function used for scoring of the waggle competition is

\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{y_ilog(p_i)+ (1-y_i)log(1-p_i)}{n},
\end{equation}

Where $y_i$ is a binary variable taking value 1 when the team wins and 0 otherwise and $0 \leq p_i \leq 1$ denotes the predicted value for the team in the $i$th game.  
We ask the question how dependent on the characteristics of this particular loss function is the ranking of individual teams? 

To answer this question we studied a couple of possible alternate scoring functions. We consider the following scoring functions: 
 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:first_score_function}
-log(1-2|.5-p_i|)
\end{equation} 

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:second_score_function}
-log(1-|.5-p_i|)
\end{equation} 

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:third_score_function}
-log(1-|y_i-p_i|)
\end{equation} 
Here, for brevity, we only write the part of the loss function multiplied by the $(1-y_i)$ term in the loss function above. Moreover, in Function \ref{eqn:third_score_function}, $y_i \in \{0,.5,1\}$, where now the $0.5$ is the realized value when teams go into overtime. A plot of the different score functions for values $0\leq p_i \leq 1$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:scoring_functions}.

\end{figure}

It is clear from looking at Figure \ref{fig:scoring_functions} that the different scoring functions treat the contestants confidence differently. Both the first and the second score function are symmetric about 0.5 which is aesthetically pleasing. Moreover, the first score function penalizes much more for confident predictions than the second. 

One might wonder, given the plethora of choices one might use to rank contestants, how much is a result of a specific function and how much hold sir we move from one scoring function to another? To examine this we made a plot of the contestant predictions scored under the various loss functions described above. The results of this plot are shown in Figure \ref{fig:score_rank_plot}.

\lucasc{Now the concluding paragraph for section}

While much has been made in contest forums and in books \cite{schutt2013doing} about leakage and how leakage is often exploited to win competitions it is somewhat refreshing to see that other choices play little, if any, into the ultimate results from a competition. While luck ultimately plays a role in the basketball games themselves and the results of prediction tournaments, some players are able to consistently outperform. These consistent performs are lucky, but lucky in the sense they are endowed with particular gifts that the rest of us mortals only dream of, and practice in hopes of achieving some semblance of success.
