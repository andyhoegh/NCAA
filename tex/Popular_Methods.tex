\section{Popular Methods}  This section provides a review of several existing methods for tournament prediction.
\subsection{Rating Based Methods} 
The seeds and ratings discussed earlier contain implicit or explicit means for tournament prediction.  For instance the Sagarin rankings are designed to reflect the point spread between two teams, incorporating a term for the variance of the outcomes under a Bayesian framework provides an efficient way to compute winning probabilities.  Similarly for Pomeroy, ESPN BPI, coefficients for predicting point spreads or in a binary regression can be computed.
\subsection{Ensemble Methods}
Combining the ratings from several different sites is a popular strategy.  In fact this is the technique used by Nate Silver's 538 methodology?
\subsection{Wisdom of the Crowds?}
Another popular option would be to use the \emph{Wisdom of the Crowds}.  ESPN provides a mean probability across every bracket submitted to the site.
